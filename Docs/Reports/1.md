# Week 1

#### Activities

- Settled on topic and environment, and created the initial configuration for the project.
- Researched regular expressions and regular expression matching.
- Briefly looked into how painful it would be to implement some of the fundamental data structures using pointers in Swift, for future reference.
- Wrote the initial project specification.


#### Progress

The project itself was created, and some progress was made in planning the implementation by studying various resources on the topic.


#### What did I learn?

I learned that the regular expression matchers used by several programming languages (e.g. Perl, Python, and Java) are not optimal, although good enough most of the time. Also, Thompson's construction algorithm was new to me, and seems like a good approach to base this project on.

Furthermore, I learned that reimplementing e.g. `Array` in Swift using the pointer types provided by the standard library should be doable.


#### This week's hurdles

None.


#### Next steps

- Continue planning the core functionalities of the implementation.
- Begin working on the implementation, initially focusing on the regex-to-NFA conversion.
- Write tests while going along.


#### Time spent

11 hours, approximately.
