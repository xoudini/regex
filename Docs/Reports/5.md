# Week 5

#### Activities

- Expanded on `UnsafeArray`, and changed the internal representation of `Stack` to this.
- Added `Package.swift` for pure Swift builds.
- Additionally added support for Linux (and Docker) – see instructions in [README](/README.md).
- Wrote Makefile for common tasks, including generating code coverage reports.
- Implemented rudimentary parsing for escape sequences.
- Added support for running program from command line with arguments.
- Tested `UnsafeArray` and fixed memory leaks and a few other tiny bugs.
- Wrote some more tests.


#### Progress

The allowed syntax for regular expressions is now at a reasonable level, with support for unions (e.g. `ab|cd`), Kleene star and "once-or-more" expressions (i.e. `a*` and `a+` respectively), choice expressions (e.g. `[abc]`), optional expressions (i.e. `a?`), escapes for special characters (e.g. `\*`), and non-capturing groups (i.e. `(ab)`).

Also, the command-line interface of the program was completed (or at least a first version, if files and/or stdin need to be supported as input).


#### What did I learn?

I learned how to actually build a Swift project on Linux, and the configuration this requires.


#### This week's hurdles

Figuring out a reasonable way to parse command-line arguments. Although the current parsing method is _Good Enough™_, I'm still not completely satisfied with the solution.


#### Next steps

- Improve time complexity of matching stage.
- Consider implementing support for some common character classes (e.g. `\w`).
- Write more documentation and a syntax sheet.
- Create custom data structure for sets.
- Write more tests.


#### Time spent

14 hours, approximately.
