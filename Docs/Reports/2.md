# Week 2

#### Activities

- Started working on expression parsing logic, and selected an initial set of expressions to support.
- Implemented a generic `Stack` data structure, which is useful for the project in general.
- Implemented a recursive approach for parse tree generation.
- Wrote tests for `Stack` and some rudimentary expression parsing cases.
- Documented the pertinent parts of the code base.


#### Progress

A proof-of-concept expression parsing implementation was achieved. Also, implemented a stack data structure, although it currently isn't much more than a wrapper around the built-in `Array`. Most of the code is also tested (at least to some extent).


#### What did I learn?

I learned more about regular expressions, and perhaps a bit more about building parse trees. Although not completely new, I also remembered how bothersome it is to debug recursive functions.


#### This week's hurdles

I was a bit dissatisfied with the initial approach I tried for generating the parse tree from the given regular expression, since it didn't take into account the _"state"_, i.e. how the currently consumed character should be handled. So, I rewrote the whole thing a few times before settling on the current approach, which preserves context and isn't quite as repetitive.


#### Next steps

- Some refactoring, relating to remnants of the expression parsing rewrite.
- Add support for escape sequences (i.e. for `\[`, `\n` and so forth).
- Start working on the conversion from parse tree to NFA.
- Write tests while going along.
- If time permits, implement an array type from scratch using Swift's pointer types.
- Consider removing the character set expression in favor of the union expression, for the sake of simplicity, or alternatively reducing single-character unions into character sets, for the sake of performance.


#### Time spent

15 hours, approximately.
