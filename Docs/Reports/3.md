# Week 3

#### Activities

- Implemented the core NFA data structure.
- Implemented expression-to-NFA conversion.
- Wrote tests for NFA generation and matching cases.
- Documented the pertinent parts of the code base.
- Investigated how efficient a custom `Array` using Swift's pointer types would be.


#### Progress

The core functionality of the NFA, including matching and conversion from `Expression` instances, was completed. I also found a small bug in the expression parsing logic, which will be fixed as soon as possible.


#### What did I learn?

I learned how to construct an NFA (or at least a variation thereof) in code. Furthermore, I learned about [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS), and that the implementation this far is vulnerable to some "malicious" regex-input combinations.


#### This week's hurdles

Figuring out how the NFA should be implemented was the largest obstacle this week.


#### Next steps

- Refactoring and fix bugs related to expression parsing.
- Implement custom data structure for queues.
- Finally add support for some escape sequences.
- Write tests while going along.
- Figure out how to prevent the aforementioned ReDoS vulnerabilites.
- If time permits create custom data structure for sets.


#### Time spent

12 hours, approximately.
