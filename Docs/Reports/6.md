# Week 6

#### Activities

- Continued writing implementation and testing documents.
- Created initial syntax sheet describing supported expressions.
- Implemented map-filter-reduce methods for `UnsafeArray`, and added an unpacking method inspired by Haskell.
- Wrote inline documentation for the newly implemented features.
- Changed the remaining instances of Swift's built-in `Array` to custom data structures.
- Wrote some more tests.


#### Progress

Documentation was updated, a syntax document was created, and custom-built data structures have replaced (most) of the built-in structures.


#### What did I learn?

Not much new.


#### This week's hurdles

I introduced a dumb little bug, which took way too long to figure out. No other larger issues though.


#### Next steps

- Consider implementing NFA-to-DFA conversion for better matching efficiency.
- Add support for some common character classes (e.g. `\w`).
- Finish custom set data structure.
- Write more tests.
- Finalize the project.


#### Time spent

11 hours, approximately.
