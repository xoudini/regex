# Week 4

#### Activities

- Started implementing custom pointer-based array type. No tests for this yet, since it's not in use.
- Found and fixed bug related to expression parsing, which caused consecutive union expressions to be parsed incorrectly.
- Implemented custom generic `Queue` data structure, still using Foundation's `Array` as internal representation.
- Wrote tests for `Queue`, and wrote inline documentation.
- Investigated malicious regexes and how to potentially guard against them.
- Refactoring.


#### Progress

In practice, the core functionality of the matching logic was completed, with some limitations regarding allowed syntax of the input regular expressions.


#### What did I learn?

I learned more about how to achieve a linear time complexity for matching inputs, although this is yet to be implemented.


#### This week's hurdles

Squashing the bug related to expression parsing was perhaps the most time-consuming activity this week. It ended up being a rather simple fix, basically just preventing recursion at depths beyond one level when parsing unions.


#### Next steps

- Finally add support for some escape sequences.
- Consider moving towards `UnsafeArray` as the internal representation for custom data structures.
- Write tests while going along.
- If time permits create custom data structure for sets.


#### Time spent

11 hours, approximately.
